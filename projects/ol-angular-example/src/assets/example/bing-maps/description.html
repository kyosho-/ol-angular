    <p>When the Bing Maps tile service doesn't have tiles for a given resolution and region it returns "placeholder"
        tiles
        indicating that. Zoom the map beyond level 19 to see the "placeholder" tiles. If you want OpenLayers to display
        stretched tiles in place of "placeholder" tiles beyond zoom level 19 then set <code>maxZoom</code> to
        <code>19</code> in the options passed to <code>ol/source/BingMaps</code>.</p>
